# üöÄ Step-by-Step Setup for Real-time & Refresh

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: You MUST follow these steps EXACTLY

Your real-time subscriptions won't work until you complete Step 1!

---

## üìã Step 1: Enable Real-time in Supabase (REQUIRED!)

### 1.1 Go to Supabase Dashboard
- Open your Supabase project
- Click "SQL Editor" in the left sidebar
- Click "New Query"

### 1.2 Copy and Run This SQL

```sql
-- Enable realtime for all tables
ALTER PUBLICATION supabase_realtime ADD TABLE IF NOT EXISTS transactions;
ALTER PUBLICATION supabase_realtime ADD TABLE IF NOT EXISTS app_users;
ALTER PUBLICATION supabase_realtime ADD TABLE IF NOT EXISTS balance_history;
ALTER PUBLICATION supabase_realtime ADD TABLE IF NOT EXISTS admin_deductions;

-- Verify it worked
SELECT * FROM pg_publication_tables WHERE pubname = 'supabase_realtime';
```

### 1.3 Check the Output
You should see 4 rows in the results:
```
pubname              | schemaname | tablename
---------------------+------------+-------------------
supabase_realtime    | public     | transactions
supabase_realtime    | public     | app_users
supabase_realtime    | public     | balance_history
supabase_realtime    | public     | admin_deductions
```

If you don't see all 4 tables, the SQL didn't work. Try again!

### 1.4 Reload Schema Cache

Go to Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí API ‚Üí Click "Reload schema cache"

OR run this SQL:
```sql
NOTIFY pgrst, 'reload schema';
```

**WAIT 10 SECONDS after reloading the schema cache!**

---

## üîÑ Step 2: Restart Your Dev Server

### 2.1 Stop the server
- Press `Ctrl+C` in your terminal

### 2.2 Start it again
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 2.3 Wait for it to fully start
- Look for "Local: http://localhost:5173"
- Make sure there are no errors

---

## üß™ Step 3: Test Real-time Subscriptions

### 3.1 Open Two Browser Windows

**Window 1 (Admin):**
- Go to `http://localhost:5173`
- Login as admin
- Navigate to "AKRA" page from sidebar
- Open browser console (F12)
- You should see: `‚úÖ Akra real-time subscription active`

**Window 2 (User):**
- Open a NEW INCOGNITO/PRIVATE window
- Go to `http://localhost:5173`
- Login as a regular user
- Go to user dashboard

### 3.2 Test Bulk Entry

In **Window 2 (User)**:
1. In the Number box, type: `00 01 02 03`
2. In the First box, type: `400`
3. Click "Add Entry"
4. You should see 4 entries appear in your history

In **Window 1 (Admin)** - DO NOT REFRESH:
1. Watch the console (F12)
2. You should see: `üî¥ Real-time update received for Akra:`
3. The page should update INSTANTLY
4. You should see 4 separate entries:
   - 00 - First: 400
   - 01 - First: 400
   - 02 - First: 400
   - 03 - First: 400

### 3.3 What If It Doesn't Work?

**Check Console Logs:**
- Open F12 in both windows
- Look for subscription status messages
- If you see "Channel not subscribed" - Go back to Step 1
- If you see "CLOSED" status - Restart dev server (Step 2)

**Still Not Working?**
1. Close BOTH browser windows completely
2. Stop dev server (Ctrl+C)
3. Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)
4. Start dev server again (`npm run dev`)
5. Open fresh browser windows

---

## üîµ Step 4: Test Silent Refresh Button

### 4.1 Find the Refresh Button
- Login as admin
- Go to any admin page (Open, Akra, Ring, Packet)
- Look at the header
- You should see a BLUE circular arrow button next to "Admin Panel"

### 4.2 Click the Refresh Button
- Click the blue refresh button
- Check console (F12)
- You should see: `üîÑ Triggering silent refresh...`
- The data should update INSTANTLY
- **NO loading spinner should appear**
- **NO page reload should happen**
- Only the numbers/data should refresh

### 4.3 Test on Different Pages
Try the refresh button on:
- ‚úÖ Admin Open page
- ‚úÖ Admin Akra page
- ‚úÖ Admin Ring page
- ‚úÖ Admin Packet page
- ‚úÖ User Management page
- ‚úÖ Admin Dashboard page

---

## üìä Step 5: Verify Bulk Entries Work Correctly

### 5.1 Test Different Patterns

In User Dashboard, try these:

**Pattern 1: Space-separated**
- Number: `00 01 02 03 04`
- First: `500`
- Result: 5 entries, each with First: 500

**Pattern 2: Comma-separated**
- Number: `10,11,12,13`
- Second: `300`
- Result: 4 entries, each with Second: 300

**Pattern 3: Mixed**
- Number: `20 21 22 23`
- First: `200`
- Second: `100`
- Result: 4 entries, each with First: 200 AND Second: 100

**Pattern 4: With inline amounts**
- Number: `30 31 32 first 600 second 400`
- Result: 3 entries (30, 31, 32), each with First: 600 and Second: 400

### 5.2 Check Admin View

After adding each pattern:
1. Go to admin Akra page
2. You should see ALL individual entries
3. Each number should be separate
4. NO loading spinner
5. Updates should be INSTANT

## üêõ Troubleshooting Guide

### Problem 1: "Real-time not working"

**Symptoms:**
- Admin page doesn't update when user adds entry
- Must manually refresh to see new data

**Solutions:**
1. Check if SQL was run (Step 1)
2. Check console for subscription status
3. Verify `‚úÖ Akra real-time subscription active` message
4. Restart dev server
5. Clear browser cache

### Problem 2: "Refresh button does nothing"

**Symptoms:**
- Click blue refresh button
- Nothing happens
- No console logs

**Solutions:**
1. Check console for `üìù Registering refresh callback`
2. If not there, refresh the page completely
3. Check if you're on an admin page (not user page)
4. Make sure you're logged in as admin

### Problem 3: "Bulk entries not splitting"

**Symptoms:**
- Enter "00 01 02 03"
- Only see 1 entry instead of 4

**Solutions:**
1. Check if you're entering numbers in the Number box (not Name box)
2. Verify spaces or commas between numbers
3. Check console for parsing errors
4. Make sure you're using StandardEntry (not IntelligentEntry)

### Problem 4: "Page refreshes/reloads"

**Symptoms:**
- Click refresh button
- Whole page reloads
- Loading spinner appears

**Solutions:**
1. This is old behavior - make sure you pulled latest code
2. Run `git pull origin main`
3. Run `npm install`
4. Restart dev server
5. Hard refresh browser (Ctrl+Shift+R)

### Problem 5: "Console shows 'Channel not subscribed'"

**Symptoms:**
- Console error: Channel not subscribed
- Real-time doesn't work

**Solutions:**
1. **YOU DIDN'T RUN THE SQL IN STEP 1!**
2. Go back to Step 1.2
3. Run the SQL commands
4. Wait 10 seconds
5. Restart dev server

## üìû Still Having Issues?

If you've followed ALL steps and it still doesn't work:

1. Take a screenshot of:
   - Supabase SQL output (Step 1.3)
   - Browser console logs (F12)
   - Network tab in DevTools

2. Check these files exist:
   - `src/contexts/AdminRefreshContext.tsx`
   - `supabase/migrations/20250128000000_enable_realtime.sql`

3. Verify your `.env` file has:
   - `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`
   - `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
   - `VITE_SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY`

4. Make sure you're on the `main` branch:
   ```bash
   git branch
   # Should show: * main
   ```

5. Pull latest changes:
   ```bash
   git pull origin main
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```
