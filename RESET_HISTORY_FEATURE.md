# User History Reset Feature

## Overview
Added a new "Reset History" feature in the Admin User Management page that allows administrators to permanently delete all transaction history for a specific user.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Service (`src/services/database.ts`)

#### New Function: `resetUserHistory(userId: string)`
- **Purpose**: Deletes all transactions and admin deductions for a specific user
- **Returns**: `{ deletedCount: number }` - The number of transactions deleted
- **Actions**:
  - Counts transactions before deletion
  - Deletes all transactions for the user from `transactions` table
  - Deletes all admin deductions associated with the user from `admin_deductions` table
  - Clears transaction cache
- **Safety**: Uses retry mechanism with exponential backoff for network reliability

```typescript
async resetUserHistory(userId: string): Promise<{ deletedCount: number }>
```

### 2. User Management Page (`src/pages/admin/UserManagement.tsx`)

#### New Handler: `handleResetUserHistory(user: UserData)`
- **Double Confirmation System**: 
  - First confirmation explains what will be deleted
  - Second confirmation shows exact entry count for final verification
- **Features**:
  - Displays detailed warning about permanent deletion
  - Shows count of entries to be deleted
  - Automatically closes expanded history panel after reset
  - Shows success message with deletion count
  - Triggers automatic user list reload

#### UI Changes
- **New Button**: "üîÑ Reset History"
  - **Position**: Bottom of user card, spanning full width (col-span-2)
  - **Styling**: 
    - Red background (danger color)
    - Red border for emphasis
    - Warning icon (üîÑ)
  - **Layout**: Added to existing button grid, now contains:
    1. üí∞ Load (top-left)
    2. ‚úèÔ∏è Edit (top-right)
    3. üìú History (middle-left)
    4. üìÑ PDF (middle-right)
    5. üîÑ Reset History (bottom, full width)

## User Flow

1. **Click "Reset History"** on any user card
2. **First Confirmation Dialog** appears:
   ```
   ‚ö†Ô∏è Are you sure you want to RESET ALL HISTORY for "[User Name]"?
   
   This will permanently delete:
   ‚Ä¢ All transactions (Open, Akra, Ring, Packet)
   ‚Ä¢ All entry history
   ‚Ä¢ All admin deductions
   
   This action CANNOT be undone!
   ```
3. **Second Confirmation Dialog** appears (if first was confirmed):
   ```
   üö® FINAL CONFIRMATION
   
   You are about to delete ALL [X] entries for [username].
   
   Are you absolutely sure?
   ```
4. **Action Executes**:
   - All transactions deleted from database
   - Admin deductions removed
   - Success notification shows deletion count
   - User list automatically refreshes
   - History panel closes if it was open

## Safety Features

### 1. Double Confirmation
- Prevents accidental deletions with two separate confirmation dialogs
- Second confirmation shows exact entry count

### 2. Data Integrity
- Uses database transactions with retry mechanism
- Cleans up both transactions and admin deductions
- Maintains referential integrity

### 3. User Feedback
- Clear warning messages before deletion
- Success message confirms exact number of deleted entries
- Error handling with user-friendly error messages

### 4. Real-time Updates
- Automatic user list refresh after reset
- Real-time subscription ensures all admins see updated data
- Closes expanded history panel to prevent stale data

## Technical Details

### Database Operations
1. **Count Query**: Gets exact transaction count before deletion
   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM transactions WHERE user_id = ?
   ```

2. **Delete Transactions**: Removes all user transactions
   ```sql
   DELETE FROM transactions WHERE user_id = ?
   ```

3. **Delete Admin Deductions**: Cleans up related deductions
   ```sql
   DELETE FROM admin_deductions WHERE admin_user_id = ?
   ```

### Error Handling
- Network errors: Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- Database errors: User-friendly error notifications
- Partial failures: Warns on deduction deletion errors but continues

### Cache Management
- Clears transaction cache after deletion
- Ensures fresh data on next load
- Real-time subscriptions trigger automatic UI updates

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Reset history with 0 entries
- [ ] Reset history with multiple entries
- [ ] Cancel first confirmation dialog
- [ ] Cancel second confirmation dialog
- [ ] Verify all transactions deleted from database
- [ ] Verify admin deductions deleted
- [ ] Verify user balance remains unchanged
- [ ] Verify real-time updates across admin panels
- [ ] Test error handling with network issues
- [ ] Verify expanded history panel closes after reset

## Security Considerations

- **Admin Only**: Button only visible in admin panel
- **RLS Policies**: Database policies ensure only admins can delete
- **Audit Trail**: Consider adding audit logging (future enhancement)
- **Soft Delete Option**: Currently hard delete; could add soft delete option

## Future Enhancements

1. **Audit Logging**: Log reset actions for compliance
2. **Selective Reset**: Option to reset specific entry types only
3. **Date Range Reset**: Reset entries within specific date range
4. **Undo Feature**: Temporary holding period before permanent deletion
5. **Export Before Reset**: Automatic backup before deletion

## Notes

- User balance is **NOT** affected by history reset
- Only transactions are deleted, user account remains active
- Admin deductions are cleaned up to maintain data consistency
- Real-time subscriptions ensure immediate UI updates across all admin sessions
