2. Open file `MANUAL_MIGRATION_FIX.sql` (in project root)
3. Copy ALL and paste into Supabase SQL Editor

### STEP 2: Test Everything

2. Click each button from 1-7 in order
3. Watch for green ‚úÖ checkmarks in the results panel
4. If you see red ‚ùå, copy the error message

### STEP 3: Try Real Features
1. Go to `/admin/filter` ‚Üí Apply filter ‚Üí Click "Save Filter"
   - Should see: "‚úÖ Created X admin deductions"
2. Go to `/admin/users` ‚Üí Click delete icon on a user
   - Should see: "‚úÖ User deleted successfully"

## If Step 1 Fails
- Make sure you're in the CORRECT Supabase project
- Check you have admin access to run SQL

- Restart your dev server: Stop (Ctrl+C) then `npm run dev`
- Check browser console (F12) for errors
